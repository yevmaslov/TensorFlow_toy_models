### Dataset

Data from two different datasets are joined together and used.
The first dataset is called the News Aggregator dataset generated by the Artificial
Intelligence Lab, part of the Faculty of Engineering at Roma Tre University in Italy.
The University of California, Irvine, has made the dataset available for download

over 420,000 news article titles, URLs, and other information. The second dataset is a
set of over 200,000 news articles from The Huffington Post, called the News Category
